# Immerse

## Description

Immerse is an application where travelers can book a travel package to a desination that they have been yearning to go so they can fully immerse themsevles in a new experience.

## Setup

This contains the frontend and backend of Immerse, constructed with React.js, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, and custom CSS.

Some features I would like to implement in the near future is to implement Redux for state, utilize Chakra UI to style the application, and add more functionality to the dates for the project.

## Install the project

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the repository

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:vmaineng/Immerse.git
$ cd Immerse
$ code .
```

## Setup

```sh
 bundle install
 rails db:create
 npm install --prefix client

```

Then, 

```sh
rails s: run the backend on http://localhost:3000
npm start --prefix client: run the frontend on http://localhost:4000
```
