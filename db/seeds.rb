# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# puts "Location name.."
# l1 = Location.create(name: "Bahamas")
# l2 = Location.create(name: "Bali")
# l3 = Location.create(name: "California")
# l4 = Location.create(name: "Wisconsin")

# puts "Category name..."
# c1 = Category.create(name: "Beach")
# c2 = Category.create(name: "Camping")
# c3 = Category.create(name: "Cruise")
# c4 = Category.create(name: "Relax")


# puts "Experience details.."
# e1 = Experience.create(name: "Relax and Rest in Ubud", description: "Take a moment to relax and restore in this beautiful scenery", dt_booked_from:12/01/2022, dt_booked_to: 12/05/2022, price: 50, category_id: c4.id, location_id: l2.id)
